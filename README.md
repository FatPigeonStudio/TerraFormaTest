-1. Scroll to the bottom right and click the blue icon to fullscreen the game, or leave it alone if your screen is higher than 1080
0. Probably mute the game for now, there's nothing worth hearing yet
1. To play, go to Missions > Custom Scenario > Begin Mission
2. Place a module to build a tower. Place a different module on top to get elemental powers, or the same module to create a new type of tower
3. Normal left click on a tower to see its stats, and levelup/sell it
4. Building a tower is $100, putting a second module on costs 50, levelup is based on current tower level
5. Killing a boss every 10 waves grants a Super point that can be applied to a same-module tower to turn it into yet another new tower type, and in a future build will be exchangeable for HP.
6. ESC to pause. Some of this UI element is incomplete/does not work
7. The tutorial is functional
